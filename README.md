# Leveraging Machine Learning for Precision Medicine in Ghana
Machine Learning with Graphs using RGCN for link prediction, cosine similarity and node2vec for predicting novel associations and streamlit for web interface.

## 🙌🏽 Research Question and Objective
Research indicates that machine learning for precision medicine significantly improves patient survival outcomes in developed countries. However, a noticeable gap exists in its application in developing countries, such as Ghana. Hence, there is a critical need to establish systems dedicated to delivering personalized treatments using machine learning. This research investigates the question, “can machine learning be leveraged to develop personalized plans in the context of Ghana’s personalized healthcare system?”
